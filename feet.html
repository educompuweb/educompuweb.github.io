Launched at the CES tech fair this week, the trainer features laces that are hidden beneath the tongue of the shoe, and which can be tightened or loosened using an app.</p>

	<p>Nike took futuristic footwear out of Back to the Future and put it into prototype with the Nike Mag, advancing what was coined the Nike Mag’s “power laces,” with digital technology. The result is an individually responsive system that senses the wearer’s motion to provide adaptive on-demand comfort and support. You can even check out a video of Michael J Fox trying them on.  With this kind of adaptive technology, it seems like the future has arrived.</p>
